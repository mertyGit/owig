Overwatch Information Grabber
This program runs alongside your Overwatch game and get statistics and other information by grabbing screen on certain intervals and deciphering it.
Information will be displayed on seperate window and written to disk to be analyzed later on with tool of your choice.

At this moment, will work only with three resolutions: 1080p (1920x1080), WQHD (2560x1440) or 4K (3840x2160). 
Don't use programs that are using overlays like Discord, it will mess with the recognition

# More about OWIG
OWIG is program that will gather game statics while Overwatch game is running or by feeding it screenshots
It consists out of a windows program that will run alongside the overwatch game and will do a screenshot every second (configurable). This screenshot will be intepreted, digits will be ocr-ed and information in the screen will be interpreted by looking at distinguish features like pixel colors and appereance of buttons on the screen. 

In short, it takes a screenshot like this:
![Example screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mertyGit/owig/master/doc/screenshot_example.png)

And tries to decrypt the information writes it to disk and to the Windows GUI screen:
